A Blackberry 10 client to the ownCloud News application

Introduction
============

From the ashes of Google Reader came the ownCloud news application. owncloud-News provides a great alternative to Google Reader, however I typically
like to read feeds from my phone. While there are numerous Google Reader mobile clients, there are far fewer for ownCloud, and none (that I know of) for Blackberry 10),
so I wrote my own!
